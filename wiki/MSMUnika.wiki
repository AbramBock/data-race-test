*Legend :*

 *  *_d_ :* Memory location.
 *  *_TS,,i,, || TS,,j,,_ :* Thread segment i and j are concurrent accesses to d. 
 *  *_TS,,i,, â†’  TS,,j,,_ :* Thread segment i happens before Thread segment j. 
 *  *_L,,t,,_ :* Current set of locks held by thread t.
 *  *_C,,d,,_ :* Current set of locks protecting variable d.

Compared to [MSMHelgrind] this state machine has overal 8 states: 
  
  * *Exclusive-Read,Exclusive-Write,Exclusive-Read-Write:* only Happens-before will be checked identical to exclusive state in [MSMHelgrind]. 
  * *Shared-Read, Shared-Midified1 :* only Lockset refinement is done (same as in [MSMHelgrind]).
  * *Shared-Modified2 :* Happens-before and Lockset refinement.
  * *Race :* once a race is reported. 



More details about *MSMUnika* is going to be published soon.
