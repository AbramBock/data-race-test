#summary Unit tests for data race detector.

The file [http://data-race-test.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/unittest/racecheck_unittest.cc racecheck_unittest.cc] 
contains various unit tests for a data race detector. The tests are named test01, test02, and so on. For details see the source. 

The table below summarises the results of the state machines on this test suite.  

A machine fails a test if it finds a non-existing race or if it does not find a real race.
