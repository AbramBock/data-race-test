Edges that lead to states !NoAccess and  New are not shown. 

*SS_update*:
{{{
  def SS_update:
    newSS = {currS}
    for S in oldSS: 
      if(!HB(S,currS)): 
        newSS.insert(S)
    SS = newSS
}}}

*LS_update*:
{{{
  def LS_update: 
    if(HB(oldSS, currS)): 
      newLS = currLS
    else:
      newLS = intersect(LS, currLS)
    LS = newLS
}}}


Compared to MSMHelgrind this state machine fixes at least these tests: 
  * False negative *test10*. 
  * False positives *test11*, *test12*, *test13*, *test14*, *test16*, *test17*, *test32*, *test39*, *test40*.
This state machine still has several false positives (*test28, test29, test36, test38*).
See tests in RacecheckUnittest. 

Tests *test16, test17, test39* pass with this machine only with BarrierSupport.  


== Performance considerations == 
This scheme is most likely slower than the MSMHelgrind, but various optimizations should be possible. 
  * HB (happens before) should be computed only once per state transition. 
  * HB results could be cached for {segment-set,segment} pairs (for {segment,segment} pairs it is already cached). 
  * For large segment sets we may want to be more conservative and assume HB==False for all segments (performance vs accuracy trade-off). 
  * A segment set consisting of just one segment should not require any function call to extract the single segment.
