= Alternative memory state machines for helgrind =

On this page I would like to collect links to various known state machines for Eraser-like algorithms and discuss some new approaches. 

== Legend == 
  * *W* -- write (modification) access. 
  * *R* -- read-only access.
  * *T* -- a thread. 
  * *S* -- a thread segment. 
  * *L* -- a lock. 

  * *TS* -- a thread set (set of threads). 
  * *SS* -- a segment set (set of thread segments).
  * *LS* -- a lock set (set of locks). 

  * *TS={T1,T2,...,Tn}* -- a thread set consisting of threads T1,T2,...Tn.
  * *SS={S1,S2,...,Sn}*  -- a segment set consisting of segments S1,S2,...,Sn
  * *LS={L1,L2,...,Lm}* -- a lock set consisting of locks L1,L2,...,Lm. 

  * State named 'State R' consisting of segment set SS, locks set LS, all accesses are read-only.

  * State named 'State W' consisting of segment set SS, locks set LS, at least one access was modification.
