= Alternative memory state machines for helgrind =

On this page I would like to collect links to various known state machines for Eraser-like algorithms and discuss some new approaches. 

== Legend == 
  * *W* -- write (modification) access. 
  * *R* -- read-only access.
  * *T* -- a thread. 
  * *TS* -- a threadset (set of therads). 
  * *TS={T1,T2,...,Tn}* -- a theradset consisting of threads T1,T2,...Tn.
  * *S* -- a threadsegment. 
  * *SS* -- a segment set (set of thread segments).
  * *SS={S1,S2,...,Sn}*  -- a segmentset consisting of segments S1,S2,...,Sn
  * *L* -- a lock. 
  * *LS* -- a lockset (set of locks). 
  * *LS={L1,L2,...,Lm}* -- a lockset consisting of locks L1,L2,...,Lm.
