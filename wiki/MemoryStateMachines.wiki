#summary Discussion of possible memory state machines for helgrind.

On this page I would like to collect links to various known state machines for Eraser-like algorithms and discuss some new approaches.

  * [MSMProp1]
  * [MSMProp2]


== Legend == 
  * *W* -- write (modification) access. 
  * *R* -- read-only access.
  * *T* -- a thread. 
  * *S* -- a thread segment. 
  * *L* -- a lock. 

  * *TS* -- a thread set (set of threads). 
  * *SS* -- a segment set (set of thread segments). All segments in a segment set belong to different threads. 
  * *LS* -- a lock set (set of locks). 

  * *TS={T1,T2,...,Tn}* -- a thread set consisting of threads T1,T2,...Tn.
  * *SS={S1,S2,...,Sn}*  -- a segment set consisting of segments S1,S2,...,Sn
  * *LS={L1,L2,...,Lm}* -- a lock set consisting of locks L1,L2,...,Lm. 

  * *T(S)* -- thread to which the segment S belongs. 
  * *TS(SS)* -- set of threads to which segments of SS belong. 

  * *HB(S1, S2)* -- S1 happens before S2 (including cases when S1==S2 and when S1 and S2 are segments of the same thread).
  * *HB(SS, S)* -- all segments from SS happen before the segment S. 


  * State named 'State R'. The memory location was read in thread segments SS with common locks LS.

  * State named 'State W'. The memory location was accessed in thread segments SS with common locks LS. At least one access to this memory location was modification.

  * State named 'State WR'. The memory location was modified in thread segments SSW with common locks LSW. Also the memory location was accessed read-only in thread segments SSR with common locks LSR.
