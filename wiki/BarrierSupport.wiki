#summary Support for barrier in helgrind

To support a barrier in helgrind we need to have multiple predecessors in happens-before graph.

Alternative, better approach (suggested by Arndt Mühlenfeld in his PhD, TODO: add link) is to create fake segments:

So, to support barriers we did: 
   * Hacked =evh__HG_PTHREAD_COND_SIGNAL_PRE= to create a fake segment. (*TODO* Implementation is not clean). 
   * Added interceptor for =pthread_barrier_t= to [http://data-race-test.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/helgrind/hg_interceptors.c hg_interceptors.c].
