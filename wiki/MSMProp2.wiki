#summary Proposed memory state machine, MSMProp2
*TODO*

DISCLAIMER: this state machine has not (yet) been tested.

Edges (state transitions):

Edges that lead to states !NoAccess and  New are not shown. 

Note, that !WriteRead({},{},SSR,LSR)==Read(SSR,LSR) and !WriteRead(SSW,LSW,{},{})==Write(SSW,LSW). 
States Read and Write are inroduced to simplify understanding.
