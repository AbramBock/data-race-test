= Patches to the 'official' helgrind =

Here we list the patches to the official helgrind that are (or will be) made to helgrind as a part of this project. 

*TODO*: the actual patches are not here yet. 

== Client requests == 
  * `_VG_USERREQ__HG_GET_THREAD_ID` -- to make helgrind debugging more verbose. 
  * `_VG_USERREQ__HG_EXPECT_RACE` -- to support _positive_ unit tests. 

== Dynamic annotations ==
See [http://data-race-test.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/unittest/dynamic_annotations.h `dynamic_annotations.h`] in `trunk/unittest` for details.
