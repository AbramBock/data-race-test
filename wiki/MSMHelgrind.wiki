Edges (state transitions): 

||Edge|| access type             || condition                     || new state ||
||E1  || new memory is allocated || - || - ||
||E2  || read or write    || First access after allocation || newS=currentS ||
||E3  || read or write    || T(oldS)==T(currentS) or happens-before(oldS, currentS). ||newS=currentS. ||
||E4  || read || T(S)!=T(currentS) || newTS={oldS,newS} ||
||E5  || read ||                   || newTS=union(oldTS,currentS) ||
||E6  || write|| T(S)!=T(currentS) || newTS={oldS,newS} ||
