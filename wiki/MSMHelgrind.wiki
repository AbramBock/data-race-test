#summary Memory state machine implemented in helgrind 3.3.0

Edges that lead to states NoAccess and to New are not shown.

Edges (state transitions): 
  * E1: new memory is allocated. 
  * E2: First read or write access to this memory after allocation. Current thread segment S is stored. 
  * E3: 
    * T(oldS)=T(newS), i.e. access in the same thread. 
    * happens-before(oldS, newS), i.e. old segment and new segment are in different threads but old segment must happen before new segment (due to conditional variable, semaphore or thread join).
