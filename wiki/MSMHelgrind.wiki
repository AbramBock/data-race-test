Edges that lead to states !NoAccess and to New are not shown.

Edges (state transitions): 
||E1 || new memory is allocated. ||
  * E2: read or write. First read after allocation. 
  * E3: read or write. T(oldS)==T(currentS) or happens-before(oldS, currentS). newS=currentS. 
  * E4: read access. T(S)!=T(currentS). newTS={oldS,newS}.
  * E5: read access. newTS=union(oldTS,currentS). 
  
  * E6: write access. T(S)!=T(currentS). newTS={oldS,newS}.
