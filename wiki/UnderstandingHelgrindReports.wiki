#summary Helgrind reports explained on examples 

The goal of this page 

Simple races could be obvious once you get a report from Helgrind. <br>
However in some cases getting a Helgrind report is just a beginning of the bug analysis. <br>
Here we show several exemplary races with corresponding reports and explain how to analyze the races in each case. <br>

*TODO*: Under construction! 

All the examples on this page are taken from RacecheckUnittest. 

=Simple race=
The simplest example of data race is *test301* of RacecheckUnittest.
